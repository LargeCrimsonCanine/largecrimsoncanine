## What operation or capability are you requesting?

Be specific. If you are requesting a mathematical operation, name it precisely and include a reference if possible.

## Why is this needed?

What use case does this enable? What problem does it solve?

## Mathematical definition

If relevant, define the operation precisely. Include references (with enough detail to locate the specific definition — chapter, section, equation number where possible).

## Alternatives considered

Have you found workarounds using existing LCC operations? Are there other libraries that implement this?

## Are you willing to contribute an implementation?

Yes / No / Maybe — no obligation either way, just helpful to know.
